1
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,080
Towels.

2
00:01:38,360 --> 00:01:39,680
Lord Miraz?

3
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:42,120
You have a son.

4
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:48,120
The heavens have blessed us.

5
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:53,120
You know your orders.

6
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,640
General Glozelle?

7
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes, my lord.

8
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
Five more minutes.

9
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:42,560
Won't be watching
the stars tonight, my prince.

10
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,640
Come. We must hurry.

11
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,040
- Professor, what's going on?
- Your aunt has given birth...

12
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,520
...to a son.

13
00:02:58,960 --> 00:03:00,200
Come.

14
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,080
You must make for the woods.

15
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:55,520
- The woods?
- They won't follow you there.

16
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,360
It has taken me
many years to find this.

17
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,520
Do not use it except
at your greatest need.

18
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,760
Will I ever see you again?

19
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,840
I dearly hope so, my prince.

20
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,720
There is so much more
I meant to tell you.

21
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:19,480
Everything you know
is about to change.

22
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,640
Close the drawbridge!

23
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:23,760
Now, go.

24
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,760
- Halt!
- Halt!

25
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:49,840
A son! A son!

26
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:54,480
Lady Prunaprismia has this night
given Lord Miraz a son!

27
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Which of you superstitious old women
wants to spend the night in a cell?

28
00:08:03,800 --> 00:08:05,280
He's seen us.

29
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:20,960
Take care of him.

30
00:08:27,640 --> 00:08:29,640
No!

31
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:37,040
- Mind yourself, love.
- I'm sorry.

32
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,840
Watch where you're going!

33
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,560
Wait for me!

34
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,320
You go to Saint Finbar's?

35
00:08:56,400 --> 00:08:57,560
That's right.

36
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:01,040
I go to Hendon House.
Across the road.

37
00:09:02,160 --> 00:09:03,600
I've seen you...

38
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,640
...sitting by yourself.

39
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:12,800
Yes, well, I prefer to be left alone.

40
00:09:15,240 --> 00:09:16,720
Me, too.

41
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,880
What's your name?

42
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:23,240
- Phyllis.
- Susan!

43
00:09:25,600 --> 00:09:27,600
You'd better come quickly.

44
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:33,000
Paper here!

45
00:09:34,040 --> 00:09:35,720
Get your daily paper!

46
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:14,640
Edmund!

47
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,200
Go on! Kick him in the face!

48
00:10:32,080 --> 00:10:34,800
Stop it. Break it up.
That's enough. Come on.

49
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,960
That's it. Get up.

50
00:10:39,160 --> 00:10:40,280
Act your age!

51
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,000
- You're welcome.
- I had it sorted.

52
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,160
What was it this time?

53
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,720
- He bumped me.
- So you hit him?

54
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,200
No. After he bumped me,
they tried to make me apologise.

55
00:11:03,280 --> 00:11:05,000
- That's when I hit him.
- Really?

56
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,240
- Is it that hard just to walk away?
- I shouldn't have to.

57
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,440
I mean, don't you ever get tired
of being treated like a kid?

58
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:13,120
We are kids.

59
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,080
Well, I wasn't always.

60
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,160
It's been a year.

61
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,680
How long does he expect us to wait?

62
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:24,320
I think it's time to accept
that we live here.

63
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,880
It's no use pretending any different.

64
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,160
Oh, no.

65
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:36,040
- Pretend you're talking to me.
- We are talking to you.

66
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:41,080
- Quiet, Lu.
- Something pinched me!

67
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,680
- Stop pulling!
- Not touching you.

68
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:46,000
Look, would all of you just...
What is that?

69
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,440
- It feels like magic.
- Everyone hold hands.

70
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:50,520
- I'm not holding your hand!
- Just...

71
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:59,040
Shame you're not as quick as me, Ed!

72
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,440
Last one in's a rotten egg.

73
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,680
Watch out!

74
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,960
Here it comes!

75
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:16,000
Wait a minute!

76
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:21,480
Come on, Susan. Hurry up!

77
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,120
Come on, it's lovely.

78
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:27,680
Edmund.

79
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,280
Ed? Ed!

80
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:40,480
- What is it?
- Where do you suppose we are?

81
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,400
Well, where do you think?

82
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:45,360
Well, I don't remember
any ruins in Narnia.

83
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:40,360
Wonder who lived here.

84
00:14:48,080 --> 00:14:50,120
I think we did.

85
00:14:58,480 --> 00:14:59,960
Hey, that's mine.

86
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:02,480
- From my chess set.
- Which chess set?

87
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:06,000
I didn't exactly have a solid gold
chess set in Finchley, did I?

88
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:13,040
Can't be.

89
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:22,400
- Don't you see?
- What?

90
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:25,600
lmagine walls.

91
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:30,240
And columns, there.

92
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,200
And a glass roof.

93
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,160
Cair Paravel.

94
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:26,080
Wait. Wait, my lord.
It is not what you think.

95
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:28,400
Then what is it?

96
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:30,320
We're not exactly sure.

97
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
Impossible.

98
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,520
I warned this council when it
put its trust in Lord Miraz...

99
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,120
- ...there would be consequences.
- No.

100
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:58,080
We can't accuse
the Lord Protector without proof.

101
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:01,240
How long are we going
to hide behind that excuse?

102
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:04,560
Until every chair
in this chamber is empty?

103
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:09,760
Lords of the council,
my apologies for being late.

104
00:17:09,840 --> 00:17:12,640
I wasn't aware we were in session.

105
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:15,760
No doubt you were otherwise occupied.

106
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,960
My lord?

107
00:17:20,720 --> 00:17:23,840
Ever since the death
of Caspian the ninth,

108
00:17:23,920 --> 00:17:27,320
you've behaved
as if you were king.

109
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:31,600
Now it seems that from behind his walls
even Prince Caspian has gone missing.

110
00:17:32,600 --> 00:17:35,600
My deepest condolences, Lord Miraz.

111
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:39,320
Imagine, losing your nephew,

112
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:41,840
the rightful heir to the throne,

113
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:45,440
on the very night your wife
has blessed you with a son.

114
00:17:46,840 --> 00:17:49,200
Thank you, Lord Sopespian.

115
00:17:49,280 --> 00:17:52,640
Your compassion is a boon
in this troubled time.

116
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:56,440
I trust you can tell us how such
a tragedy could have occurred.

117
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,400
That is the most
disturbing news of all.

118
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:14,880
Our beloved Caspian was abducted...

119
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:20,280
...by Narnians.

120
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,320
You go too far, Miraz.

121
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:28,080
Expect us to stand by while you blame
such a blatant crime on fairy tales?

122
00:18:34,760 --> 00:18:36,040
What?

123
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:42,960
We forget, my lords,
Narnia was once a savage land.

124
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:46,320
Fierce creatures roamed free.

125
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:51,320
Much of our forefathers' blood was shed

126
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:54,000
to exterminate this vermin.

127
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,320
Or so we thought.

128
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,360
But while we've been bickering
amongst ourselves...

129
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:12,720
...they've been breeding
like cockroaches under a rock!

130
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,520
Growing stronger. Watching us.

131
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:21,560
Waiting to strike!

132
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:30,000
And you wonder why we don't like you.

133
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:35,160
Well, I intend to strike back.

134
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:41,000
Even if I have to cut down
the entire forest,

135
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:45,040
I assure you,
I will find Prince Caspian

136
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:49,280
and finish what our ancestors began.

137
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,440
- Catapults.
- What?

138
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:14,880
This didn't just happen.
Cair Paravel was attacked.

139
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:04,640
Don't suppose you have
any matches, do you?

140
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,000
No, but...

141
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:10,560
...would this help?

142
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,520
You might have mentioned that
a bit sooner.

143
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:58,400
I can't believe it.
It's all still here.

144
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:14,480
I was so tall.

145
00:22:14,560 --> 00:22:16,560
Well, you were older then.

146
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,440
As opposed to hundreds of years
later... when you're younger.

147
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,760
- What is it?
- My horn.

148
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,280
I must've left it on my saddle
the day we went back.

149
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:06,360
When Aslan bares his teeth,
winter meets its death.

150
00:23:08,040 --> 00:23:09,840
When he shakes his mane...

151
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:13,440
...we shall have spring again.

152
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:22,840
Everyone we knew...
Mr Tumnus and the Beavers...

153
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:26,800
...they're all gone.

154
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,600
I think it's time we found out
what's going on.

155
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,680
He won't stop staring.

156
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:53,760
So don't look.

157
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,800
Here's far enough.

158
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,400
Drop him!

159
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,800
Crows and crockery!

160
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:06,200
"Drop him"!

161
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:11,240
That's the best
you can come up with?

162
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,440
A simple "thank you" would suffice.

163
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,400
They were doing fine
drowning me without your help.

164
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:18,200
Maybe we should have let them.

165
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:21,400
Why were they trying
to kill you, anyway?

166
00:25:23,040 --> 00:25:25,960
They're Telmarines.
That's what they do.

167
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:29,240
Telmarines? In Narnia?

168
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:32,480
Where have you been
for the last few hundred years?

169
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,080
It's a bit of a long story.

170
00:25:44,560 --> 00:25:47,480
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

171
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:50,800
You're it?

172
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,840
You're the kings and queens of old?

173
00:25:55,160 --> 00:25:57,680
High King Peter, the Magnificent.

174
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,920
You probably could've
left off the last bit.

175
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:04,000
Probably.

176
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:07,360
You might be surprised.

177
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:12,320
You don't want to do that, boy.

178
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,480
Not me. Him.

179
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,240
Edmund!

180
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,120
You all right?

181
00:26:55,960 --> 00:26:58,000
Beards and bedsteads!

182
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,920
Maybe that horn worked after all.

183
00:27:01,800 --> 00:27:03,040
What horn?

184
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,680
This bread is so stale.

185
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:29,240
I'll just get him some soup.
He should be coming around soon.

186
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:31,600
I don't think
I hit him hard enough.

187
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:33,360
Nikabrik, he's just a boy.

188
00:27:33,440 --> 00:27:37,800
He's a Telmarine, not some lost puppy.
You said you were gonna get rid of him.

189
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:41,400
No. I said I'd take care of him.

190
00:27:41,480 --> 00:27:44,760
We can't kill him now.
I just bandaged his head.

191
00:27:44,840 --> 00:27:47,800
It would be like murdering a guest.

192
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,240
How do you think his friends
are treating their guest?

193
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:53,920
Trumpkin knew what he was doing.
It's not the boy's fault.

194
00:27:58,320 --> 00:27:59,760
Stop! Stop!

195
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,560
Hold it. No, no!

196
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:05,680
I told you we should have killed him
when we had the chance.

197
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,000
- You know why we can't.
- If we're taking a vote, I'm with him.

198
00:28:09,080 --> 00:28:11,160
We can't let him go. He's seen us.

199
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,840
That's enough, Nikabrik!

200
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,040
Or do I have to sit on your head again?

201
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:19,440
And you. Look what you made me do.

202
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:22,720
I spent half the morning on that soup.

203
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:25,920
What are you?

204
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,320
You know, it's funny
that you would ask that.

205
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:31,800
You think people would know
a badger when they saw one.

206
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:33,440
No. No, I mean...

207
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:38,200
...you're Narnians.
You're supposed to be extinct.

208
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:40,520
Sorry to disappoint you.

209
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:47,240
Here you go. Still hot.

210
00:28:47,320 --> 00:28:50,840
Since when did we open a boarding house
for Telmarine soldiers?

211
00:28:50,920 --> 00:28:52,160
I'm not a soldier.

212
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:56,880
I am Prince Caspian. The tenth.

213
00:28:57,880 --> 00:29:00,040
What are you doing here?

214
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,760
Running away.

215
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:10,680
My uncle has always wanted my throne.

216
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:16,000
I suppose I have only lived this long

217
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,680
because he did not have
an heir of his own.

218
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:25,680
- Well, that changes things.
- Yeah.

219
00:29:25,760 --> 00:29:28,040
Means we don't have
to kill you ourselves.

220
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:30,360
You're right.

221
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,600
- Where are you going?
- My uncle won't stop until I am dead.

222
00:29:35,720 --> 00:29:39,280
But you can't leave.
You're meant to save us.

223
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:42,880
Don't you know what this is?

224
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,760
You have quite a library, doctor.

225
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:19,720
Is there anything particular
you seek, my lord?

226
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:23,280
I think I've already found
what I'm looking for...

227
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:28,160
...in one of my soldiers!

228
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:50,080
What do you know
of Queen Susan's horn?

229
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,480
It was said to be magic.

230
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:55,160
Magic?

231
00:30:55,240 --> 00:31:00,320
The Narnians believed it could summon
their kings and queens of old.

232
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:04,480
At least, such was the superstition.

233
00:31:07,280 --> 00:31:11,600
And what does Caspian
know of this superstition?

234
00:31:11,680 --> 00:31:16,840
My lord, you forbade me
from mentioning the old tales.

235
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:20,960
So I did.

236
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:32,800
I will say this. If Caspian
does know of the Deep Magic,

237
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,200
my lord would have
good reason to be nervous.

238
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:52,920
First our prince...

239
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,360
...now his tutor.

240
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,600
If the members of Miraz's
own house are not safe,

241
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:02,000
- are any of us?
- Lord Sopespian!

242
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,080
Those are dangerous words,
Lord Sopespian.

243
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,920
But these are
dangerous times, general.

244
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:13,000
One should choose his words
as carefully as he chooses his friends.

245
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:21,080
How long until the bridge is finished?

246
00:32:21,160 --> 00:32:24,680
- Construction continues on schedule.
- That's not good enough.

247
00:32:24,760 --> 00:32:27,000
I need my army across that river now.

248
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:30,240
May I suggest you contribute
some of your own men?

249
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:32,520
I've only so many at my disposal.

250
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:36,000
A fact you'd be wise to remember.

251
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,720
Go to Beruna.

252
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:44,200
Take as many troops as you need.
We must get to Caspian before they do.

253
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,760
"They," my lord?

254
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:49,640
It's time you learned your history.

255
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:20,920
They're so still.

256
00:33:23,840 --> 00:33:26,680
They're trees. What'd you expect?

257
00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,520
They used to dance.

258
00:33:32,600 --> 00:33:35,680
Wasn't long after you left
that the Telmarines invaded.

259
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,600
Those who survived
retreated to the woods.

260
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:42,120
And the trees,

261
00:33:42,200 --> 00:33:46,840
they retreated so deep into themselves
that they haven't been heard from since.

262
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:50,960
I don't understand.
How could Aslan have let this happen?

263
00:33:51,040 --> 00:33:52,320
Aslan?

264
00:33:53,040 --> 00:33:55,760
Thought he abandoned us
when you lot did.

265
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:02,800
We didn't mean to leave, you know.

266
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:06,520
Makes no difference now, does it?

267
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,040
Get us to the Narnians...

268
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,200
...and it will.

269
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:50,000
Hello, there.

270
00:34:55,080 --> 00:34:58,040
It's all right. We're friends.

271
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:05,920
Don't move, Your Majesty.

272
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:14,920
Stay away from her!

273
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,680
Shoot, Susan! Shoot!

274
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:38,480
- Why wouldn't he stop?
- I suspect he was hungry.

275
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:54,560
Thanks.

276
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,200
He was wild.

277
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,040
I don't think he could talk at all.

278
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,960
Get treated like
a dumb animal long enough,

279
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,920
that's what you become.

280
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:14,480
You may find Narnia a more savage place
than you remember.

281
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,680
I can hear you.

282
00:36:37,440 --> 00:36:40,680
I just think we should wait
for the kings and queens.

283
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:45,600
Fine! Go then! See if the others
will be as understanding!

284
00:36:45,680 --> 00:36:47,200
Or maybe I'll come with you.

285
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:49,920
I want to see you
explain things to the minotaurs.

286
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:52,720
Minotaurs?

287
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:55,320
They're real?

288
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:56,880
And very bad-tempered.

289
00:36:56,960 --> 00:37:00,280
- Yeah, not to mention big.
- Huge.

290
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:04,480
What about centaurs?
Do they still exist?

291
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,520
Well, the centaurs will
probably fight on your side.

292
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:10,640
But there's no telling
what the others will do.

293
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,120
What about Aslan?

294
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,120
How do you know so much about us?

295
00:37:22,240 --> 00:37:24,920
- Stories.
- Wait a minute.

296
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:27,680
Your father told you
stories about Narnia?

297
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,160
No, my professor, he...

298
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,480
Listen, I'm sorry.

299
00:37:33,560 --> 00:37:37,400
These are not the kind of questions
you should be asking.

300
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:42,200
- What is it?
- Human.

301
00:37:42,280 --> 00:37:44,920
- Him?
- No. Them.

302
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:50,640
- There they are!
- Run!

303
00:38:03,160 --> 00:38:04,600
Now!

304
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:16,280
- Oh, no.
- Wait. I'll go.

305
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:24,800
Take it. Go!
It's more important than I am.

306
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:00,000
Get him out of here.

307
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:11,760
Where are you?

308
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:31,600
Choose your last words
carefully, Telmarine.

309
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,320
You are a mouse.

310
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:38,840
I was hoping for something
a little more original.

311
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:40,360
Pick up your sword.

312
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:45,120
No, thanks.

313
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:48,440
Pick it up! I will not fight
an unarmed man.

314
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:50,560
Which is why I might live longer

315
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:53,480
if I choose not to cross blades
with you, noble mouse.

316
00:39:53,600 --> 00:39:57,080
I said I would not fight you.
I didn't say I'd let you live!

317
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:58,840
Reepicheep!

318
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,000
- Stay your blade!
- Trufflehunter?

319
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:05,160
I trust you have a very good reason
for this untimely interruption.

320
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:08,720
- He doesn't. Go ahead.
- He's the one who blew the horn.

321
00:40:10,680 --> 00:40:13,760
- What?
- Then let him bring it forward.

322
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:20,200
This is the reason we have gathered.

323
00:40:25,880 --> 00:40:27,200
I don't remember this way.

324
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:30,440
That's the problem with girls.
You can't carry a map in your heads.

325
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:33,640
That's because our heads
have something in them.

326
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,320
I wish he'd just listen
to the D.L.F. in the first place.

327
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,560
- D.L.F.?
- Dear Little Friend.

328
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,280
Oh, that's not at all
patronising, is it?

329
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:50,600
I'm not lost.

330
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,760
No.

331
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,880
You're just going the wrong way.

332
00:40:55,960 --> 00:40:58,440
You last saw Caspian
at the Shuddering Woods,

333
00:40:58,520 --> 00:41:01,440
and the quickest way there
is to cross at the river Rush.

334
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,880
But unless I'm mistaken,
there's no crossing in these parts.

335
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,040
That explains it, then.
You're mistaken.

336
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:34,720
You see, over time, water erodes
the earth's soil, carving deeper...

337
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:36,480
Oh, shut up.

338
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:39,760
- Is there a way down?
- Yeah, falling.

339
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:42,760
Well, we weren't lost.

340
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:46,000
There's a ford near Beruna.
How do you feel about swimming?

341
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,160
I'd rather that than walking.

342
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:50,880
Aslan?

343
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,280
It's Aslan!
It's Aslan over there!

344
00:41:55,000 --> 00:41:56,800
Don't you see? He's right...

345
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:02,200
...there.

346
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,240
Do you see him now?

347
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:08,360
I'm not crazy.

348
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:11,160
He was there.
He wanted us to follow him.

349
00:42:14,320 --> 00:42:17,200
I'm sure there are any number
of lions in this wood.

350
00:42:17,280 --> 00:42:20,400
- Just like that bear.
- I think I know Aslan when I see him.

351
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:24,280
Look, I'm not about
to jump off a cliff

352
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:26,480
after someone who doesn't exist.

353
00:42:26,560 --> 00:42:28,960
The last time I didn't believe Lucy

354
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:31,480
I ended up looking pretty stupid.

355
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,200
Why wouldn't I have seen him?

356
00:42:39,280 --> 00:42:41,640
Maybe you weren't looking.

357
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:44,960
I'm sorry, Lu.

358
00:43:11,600 --> 00:43:13,240
Kill him!

359
00:43:13,320 --> 00:43:15,040
- Telmarine!
- Liar!

360
00:43:16,280 --> 00:43:17,360
Murderer!

361
00:43:17,440 --> 00:43:20,720
All this horn proves is they've stolen
yet another thing from us!

362
00:43:20,800 --> 00:43:23,640
- I didn't steal anything.
- Didn't steal anything?

363
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,560
Shall we list the things
the Telmarines have taken?

364
00:43:26,640 --> 00:43:28,240
- Our homes!
- Our land!

365
00:43:28,320 --> 00:43:30,680
- Our freedom!
- Our lives!

366
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,840
You stole Narnia!

367
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:35,280
You would hold me accountable
for all the crimes of my people?

368
00:43:35,360 --> 00:43:36,760
Accountable...

369
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,200
...and punishable.

370
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,680
That is rich coming from you, dwarf.

371
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:46,800
Have you forgotten it was your people
who fought alongside the White Witch?

372
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:50,680
And I'd gladly do it again,
if it would rid us of these barbarians.

373
00:43:50,760 --> 00:43:54,320
Then it's lucky that it is not
in your power to bring her back.

374
00:43:55,360 --> 00:43:58,880
Or are you suggesting that we ask
this boy to go against Aslan now?

375
00:44:02,200 --> 00:44:05,840
Some of you may have forgotten,
but we badgers remember well,

376
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:10,560
that Narnia was never right
except when a Son of Adam was king.

377
00:44:10,680 --> 00:44:13,600
He's a Telmarine!
Why would we want him as our king?

378
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:15,560
Because I can help you.

379
00:44:15,640 --> 00:44:18,400
- It's a trick!
- At least hear him out!

380
00:44:18,480 --> 00:44:22,040
Beyond these woods, I'm a prince.

381
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:25,720
The Telmarine throne
is rightfully mine!

382
00:44:25,800 --> 00:44:30,080
Help me claim it,
and I can bring peace between us.

383
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:35,360
It is true. The time is ripe.

384
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,800
I watch the skies,

385
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:43,440
for it is mine to watch
as it is yours to remember, badger.

386
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:50,040
Tarva, the lord of victory,
and Alambil, the lady of peace,

387
00:44:50,120 --> 00:44:53,160
have come together
in the high heavens.

388
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:58,880
And now here,
a Son of Adam has come forth...

389
00:45:00,240 --> 00:45:03,200
...to offer us back our freedom.

390
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,440
Is this possible? Do you really
think there could be peace?

391
00:45:06,520 --> 00:45:09,200
Do you? I mean, really?

392
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:14,360
Two days ago, I didn't believe
in the existence of talking animals...

393
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:17,200
...or dwarves... or centaurs.

394
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:22,000
Yet here you are
in strength and numbers

395
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,120
that we Telmarines
could never have imagined.

396
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:30,560
Whether this horn is magic or not,
it brought us together.

397
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:33,360
And together,

398
00:45:33,440 --> 00:45:36,160
we have a chance
to take back what is ours.

399
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:42,760
If you will lead us,
then my sons and I...

400
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:46,600
...offer you our swords.

401
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,320
And we offer you our lives,
unreservedly.

402
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:05,760
Miraz's army will not
be far behind us, sire.

403
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:10,880
If we are to be ready for them, we need
to hurry to find soldiers and weapons.

404
00:46:14,040 --> 00:46:17,160
I'm sure they will be here soon.

405
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,680
These ones!
And these ones!

406
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,000
Timber!

407
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:39,280
- Get back!
- Watch your back!

408
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,200
Look out!

409
00:46:44,080 --> 00:46:46,560
- Steady, steady!
- Timber!

410
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:07,080
Perhaps this wasn't the best way
to come after all.

411
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,480
So where exactly
do you think you saw Aslan?

412
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:44,160
I wish you'd all stop trying
to sound like grown-ups.

413
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:47,520
I don't think I saw him,
I did see him.

414
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,400
I am a grown-up.

415
00:47:51,200 --> 00:47:53,400
It was right over...

416
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:55,200
Lucy!

417
00:48:00,320 --> 00:48:01,560
...here.

418
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:53,920
Lucy, are you awake?

419
00:48:59,840 --> 00:49:02,000
Why do you think I didn't see Aslan?

420
00:49:07,120 --> 00:49:09,120
You believe me?

421
00:49:09,200 --> 00:49:12,160
Well, we got across the gorge.

422
00:49:14,880 --> 00:49:16,880
I don't know.

423
00:49:18,800 --> 00:49:21,360
Maybe you didn't really want to.

424
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,040
You always knew we'd be
coming back here, didn't you?

425
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,360
I hoped so.

426
00:49:35,280 --> 00:49:39,280
I finally just got used
to the idea of being in England.

427
00:49:39,360 --> 00:49:41,800
But you're happy
to be here, aren't you?

428
00:49:43,720 --> 00:49:45,840
While it lasts.

429
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:52,760
Lucy.

430
00:51:55,960 --> 00:51:57,840
Lucy.

431
00:52:06,440 --> 00:52:08,520
Aslan!

432
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:21,360
I've missed you so much!

433
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,520
- You've grown.
- Every year you grow...

434
00:52:27,600 --> 00:52:29,600
...so shall I.

435
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:35,800
Where have you been?
Why haven't you come to help us?

436
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:40,000
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

437
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,840
Susan! Wake up!

438
00:52:52,280 --> 00:52:55,840
Certainly, Lu.
Whatever you like.

439
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,240
Wake up.

440
00:53:36,520 --> 00:53:38,000
Aslan?

441
00:54:16,800 --> 00:54:18,280
No, stop!

442
00:54:40,400 --> 00:54:42,400
Prince Caspian?

443
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:45,080
Yes? And who are you?

444
00:54:45,200 --> 00:54:47,200
Peter!

445
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:00,240
- High King Peter.
- I believe you called.

446
00:55:00,320 --> 00:55:03,760
Well, yes, but...
I thought you'd be older.

447
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:07,400
If you like, we could
come back in a few years...

448
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:11,440
No. No, that's all right.
You're just...

449
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,480
You're not exactly what I expected.

450
00:55:17,600 --> 00:55:18,800
Neither are you.

451
00:55:20,160 --> 00:55:23,040
A common enemy unites
even the oldest of foes.

452
00:55:23,120 --> 00:55:27,360
We have anxiously awaited
your return, my liege.

453
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,760
Our hearts and swords
are at your service.

454
00:55:29,840 --> 00:55:31,600
Oh, my gosh, he is so cute.

455
00:55:31,680 --> 00:55:35,120
- Who said that?
- Sorry.

456
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:40,000
Your Majesty, with the greatest respect,

457
00:55:40,120 --> 00:55:43,560
I do believe "courageous,"
"courteous," or "chivalrous"

458
00:55:43,640 --> 00:55:45,840
might more befit a knight of Narnia.

459
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:49,120
Well, at least we know some of you
can handle a blade.

460
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,160
Yes, indeed. And I have
recently put it to good use,

461
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,320
securing weapons for your army, sire.

462
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:58,680
Good. Because we're going
to need every sword we can get.

463
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:02,240
Well, then, you will probably
be wanting yours back.

464
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,800
How much did they take?

465
00:56:24,880 --> 00:56:27,320
Enough weapons and armour
for two regiments.

466
00:56:27,400 --> 00:56:30,800
But... there's more.

467
00:56:33,440 --> 00:56:37,200
"You were right to fear the woods."

468
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,960
- "X"?
- Caspian. The tenth.

469
00:56:42,040 --> 00:56:45,760
I apologise, my lord.
The blame is mine.

470
00:56:45,840 --> 00:56:47,360
I know.

471
00:56:49,120 --> 00:56:50,560
Tell me, general...

472
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:53,960
...how many men did you lose?

473
00:56:54,600 --> 00:56:57,680
- None, my lord.
- None?

474
00:56:57,760 --> 00:57:02,960
They came like ghosts,
in the dead of night. We never saw them.

475
00:57:04,800 --> 00:57:07,640
Then how do you explain your injuries?

476
00:57:16,800 --> 00:57:19,040
I asked...

477
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:21,320
...how many men were killed

478
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:25,160
during this bloody Narnian attack?

479
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,960
Of which you were a fortunate survivor.

480
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,440
General...

481
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,160
...how many?

482
00:57:52,800 --> 00:57:54,720
Three.

483
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,800
I apologise, Lord Sopespian.

484
00:58:06,800 --> 00:58:11,760
Caspian is not a victim
of this savage uprising.

485
00:58:11,840 --> 00:58:13,360
He is the instigator.

486
00:58:18,520 --> 00:58:21,680
It seems Narnia is in need
of a new king.

487
00:58:31,120 --> 00:58:33,200
Well, it's good you have troops,

488
00:58:33,280 --> 00:58:37,000
but we need some fortifications.
Somewhere to train.

489
00:58:40,560 --> 00:58:44,160
So? What are they like?

490
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:49,440
Malcontents, complainers,
stubborn as mules in the morning.

491
00:58:49,560 --> 00:58:51,440
So you like them, then.

492
00:58:52,760 --> 00:58:54,600
Well enough.

493
01:00:12,920 --> 01:00:17,760
It may not be what you are used to,
but it is defensible.

494
01:00:17,840 --> 01:00:20,760
Peter. You may want to see this.

495
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,280
It's us.

496
01:00:40,600 --> 01:00:42,720
What is this place?

497
01:00:44,080 --> 01:00:45,760
You don't know?

498
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:24,560
He must know what he's doing.

499
01:02:31,600 --> 01:02:33,560
I think it's up to us now.

500
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:09,000
It's only a matter of time.

501
01:03:09,120 --> 01:03:13,040
Miraz's men and war machines
are on their way.

502
01:03:13,880 --> 01:03:16,960
That means those same men
aren't protecting his castle.

503
01:03:17,040 --> 01:03:18,720
What do you propose we do,
Your Majesty?

504
01:03:18,800 --> 01:03:21,440
- We need to get ready for it.
- To start planning for...

505
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:29,760
Our only hope is to strike them
before they strike us.

506
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:31,680
Crazy. No one has taken that castle.

507
01:03:31,760 --> 01:03:35,240
- There's always a first time.
- We'll have the element of surprise.

508
01:03:35,320 --> 01:03:38,200
- But we have the advantage here!
- If we dig in,

509
01:03:38,280 --> 01:03:41,200
we could probably
hold them off indefinitely.

510
01:03:43,000 --> 01:03:45,920
I, for one, feel safer underground.

511
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,120
Look. I appreciate
what you've done here,

512
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,760
but this isn't a fortress. It's a tomb.

513
01:03:51,840 --> 01:03:53,400
Yes. And if they're smart,

514
01:03:53,480 --> 01:03:56,360
the Telmarines will just wait
and starve us out.

515
01:03:56,440 --> 01:04:00,280
- We could collect nuts!
- Yes! And throw them at the Telmarines.

516
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:02,440
Shut up!

517
01:04:02,520 --> 01:04:04,520
I think you know where I stand, sire.

518
01:04:09,280 --> 01:04:13,200
If I get your troops in,
can you handle the guards?

519
01:04:17,520 --> 01:04:20,800
Or die trying, my liege.

520
01:04:20,880 --> 01:04:24,760
- That's what I'm worried about.
- Sorry?

521
01:04:26,560 --> 01:04:29,480
You're all acting like
there's only two options.

522
01:04:29,560 --> 01:04:32,040
Dying here, or dying there.

523
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:35,920
- I'm not sure you've been listening.
- No, you're not listening.

524
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:39,320
Or have you forgotten who really
defeated the White Witch, Peter?

525
01:04:41,760 --> 01:04:44,560
I think we've waited
for Aslan long enough.

526
01:08:39,400 --> 01:08:40,440
Professor?

527
01:09:04,360 --> 01:09:07,200
- I have to find him.
- You don't have time.

528
01:09:07,280 --> 01:09:11,160
- You need to get the gate open.
- You wouldn't be here without him.

529
01:09:11,240 --> 01:09:12,720
And neither would I.

530
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,600
You and I can deal with Miraz.

531
01:09:18,680 --> 01:09:20,840
And I can still get
to the gate in time.

532
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:48,480
Yes, I'm a mouse.

533
01:10:09,720 --> 01:10:12,480
We were expecting someone,
you know, taller.

534
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:16,200
- You're one to talk.
- Is that supposed to be irony?

535
01:10:25,240 --> 01:10:26,720
Five more minutes?

536
01:10:28,000 --> 01:10:30,560
What are you doing here?

537
01:10:32,120 --> 01:10:35,920
I didn't help you escape
just so you could break back in.

538
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:38,480
You have to get out

539
01:10:38,560 --> 01:10:41,000
before Miraz learns you're here.

540
01:10:41,080 --> 01:10:42,920
He's going to learn soon enough.

541
01:10:43,920 --> 01:10:45,560
We are giving him your cell.

542
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,880
Don't underestimate Miraz
as your father did.

543
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,560
What are you talking about?

544
01:10:55,800 --> 01:10:57,680
I'm sorry.

545
01:11:15,960 --> 01:11:19,360
Thank goodness you're safe.

546
01:11:19,440 --> 01:11:20,800
Get up.

547
01:11:26,200 --> 01:11:27,920
- Caspian?
- Stay where you are.

548
01:11:28,000 --> 01:11:31,560
- What are you doing?
- I should think it's obvious, dear.

549
01:11:31,640 --> 01:11:35,600
You know, some families might
consider this inappropriate behaviour.

550
01:11:35,680 --> 01:11:37,920
That doesn't seem to have stopped you!

551
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:40,160
But you are not like me, are you?

552
01:11:42,000 --> 01:11:45,800
It's sad. The first time
you've shown any backbone...

553
01:11:45,920 --> 01:11:47,320
...and it's such a waste.

554
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,360
Put the sword down, Caspian.

555
01:11:54,360 --> 01:11:58,400
- I don't want to do this.
- We don't want you to either.

556
01:12:03,440 --> 01:12:05,080
This used to be a private room.

557
01:12:05,160 --> 01:12:08,440
What are you doing?
You're supposed to be in the gatehouse!

558
01:12:08,520 --> 01:12:09,680
No!

559
01:12:10,680 --> 01:12:13,520
Tonight for once, I want the truth.

560
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,040
Did you kill my father?

561
01:12:21,720 --> 01:12:23,480
Now we get to it.

562
01:12:24,360 --> 01:12:26,640
You said your brother died in his sleep.

563
01:12:26,760 --> 01:12:28,720
That was more or less true.

564
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:31,920
Caspian, this won't
make things any better.

565
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:35,040
We Telmarines would have
nothing had we not taken it.

566
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:37,320
Your father knew that
as well as anyone.

567
01:12:38,240 --> 01:12:39,800
How could you?

568
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:42,400
For the same reason
you will pull that trigger.

569
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:45,560
- For our son.
- Stop!

570
01:12:45,640 --> 01:12:48,440
- Stay right there.
- You need to make a choice, dear.

571
01:12:48,520 --> 01:12:50,800
Do you want our child to be king?

572
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:53,880
Or do you want him
to be like Caspian here?

573
01:12:57,040 --> 01:12:59,600
- Fatherless!
- No!

574
01:12:59,680 --> 01:13:01,640
Caspian!

575
01:13:32,160 --> 01:13:33,960
What's that supposed to mean?

576
01:13:35,960 --> 01:13:39,520
- We're under attack!
- Sound the alarm!

577
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:42,520
Men! Grab your bows!

578
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:50,120
- Peter!
- Our troops are just outside! Come on!

579
01:13:54,920 --> 01:13:56,240
Now, Ed! Now!

580
01:13:56,320 --> 01:13:58,840
- Signal the troops!
- I'm a bit busy, Pete!

581
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,760
Peter! It's too late.
We have to call it off while we can.

582
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:26,640
No, I can still do this!

583
01:14:28,520 --> 01:14:29,760
Help me!

584
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:50,840
Exactly who are you
doing this for, Peter?

585
01:14:55,960 --> 01:14:57,240
Come on!

586
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:08,720
Charge!

587
01:15:14,280 --> 01:15:16,200
We're under attack!

588
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:24,400
Attack! Attack!

589
01:15:42,440 --> 01:15:44,200
For Narnia!

590
01:16:23,720 --> 01:16:26,000
Archers!

591
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:29,240
Pick a target!

592
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:32,800
Take aim!

593
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,400
Ed!

594
01:17:44,720 --> 01:17:46,440
Get that gate closed.

595
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:41,440
Fall back!

596
01:18:48,080 --> 01:18:49,760
We need to retreat! Now!

597
01:18:52,240 --> 01:18:54,480
Go! Get her out of here!

598
01:18:55,200 --> 01:18:57,840
Back to the gate! Go!

599
01:19:03,480 --> 01:19:06,960
- Caspian!
- I'll find him!

600
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,120
Go! Get out! Go!
Get out! Retreat!

601
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:17,800
Follow me!

602
01:19:52,600 --> 01:19:53,840
Give the order.

603
01:19:56,560 --> 01:19:58,000
My men are still down there.

604
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:01,320
Draw back!
Get out! Retreat!

605
01:20:05,240 --> 01:20:06,320
Now!

606
01:20:10,240 --> 01:20:11,880
Fire!

607
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,560
Run for your life!
Save yourself!

608
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:53,720
Peter! The bridge!

609
01:21:10,080 --> 01:21:11,520
Leave us! Go, brothers!

610
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:15,640
In the name of Aslan!

611
01:22:13,920 --> 01:22:15,760
What happened?

612
01:22:15,880 --> 01:22:17,600
Ask him.

613
01:22:18,200 --> 01:22:20,720
- Peter.
- Me?

614
01:22:20,800 --> 01:22:23,440
You could've called it off.
There was still time.

615
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,120
No, there wasn't, thanks to you.

616
01:22:25,200 --> 01:22:28,040
If you kept to the plan,
those soldiers might be alive.

617
01:22:28,120 --> 01:22:30,880
If you'd stayed here like I suggested,
they definitely would be!

618
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:34,920
- You called us, remember?
- My first mistake.

619
01:22:35,000 --> 01:22:38,400
No. Your first mistake was thinking
you could lead these people.

620
01:22:41,560 --> 01:22:45,040
I am not the one who abandoned Narnia.

621
01:22:45,120 --> 01:22:49,520
You invaded Narnia. You have no more
right to lead it than Miraz does.

622
01:22:49,600 --> 01:22:51,360
You, him, your father...

623
01:22:52,200 --> 01:22:54,760
Narnia's better off
without the lot of you.

624
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:57,000
Stop it!

625
01:23:38,200 --> 01:23:40,800
What are you all standing around for?

626
01:23:43,120 --> 01:23:45,600
Telmarines will be here soon enough.

627
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:52,040
Thank you...
my dear little friend.

628
01:23:57,760 --> 01:24:02,360
- Well done, lads.
- Move it faster, mate. Too slow!

629
01:24:12,160 --> 01:24:14,760
Beruna pledges its troops.

630
01:24:14,800 --> 01:24:18,720
Galma pledges its troops.

631
01:24:18,760 --> 01:24:21,680
Tashbaan pledges its troops.

632
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:25,400
Ettinsmoor pledges its troops.

633
01:24:55,080 --> 01:24:59,120
Long live the king!
Long live the king!

634
01:25:24,640 --> 01:25:27,640
Are you so glad
of that magic horn now, boy?

635
01:25:29,840 --> 01:25:33,040
Your kings and queens have failed us.

636
01:25:33,120 --> 01:25:38,480
Your army's half dead. And those
that aren't will be soon enough.

637
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:42,480
What do you want?
Congratulations?

638
01:25:43,960 --> 01:25:47,720
You want your uncle's blood.
So do we.

639
01:25:48,960 --> 01:25:52,800
You want his throne?
We can get it for you.

640
01:26:10,080 --> 01:26:14,440
You tried one ancient power.
It failed.

641
01:26:14,520 --> 01:26:17,680
But there is a power greater still.

642
01:26:18,560 --> 01:26:22,520
One that kept even Aslan at bay
for near a hundred years.

643
01:26:36,480 --> 01:26:38,760
Who's there?

644
01:26:39,840 --> 01:26:41,440
I am hunger.

645
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:46,320
I am thirst.

646
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:50,640
I can fast a hundred years...

647
01:26:51,760 --> 01:26:53,360
...and not die.

648
01:26:54,240 --> 01:26:57,040
I can lie a hundred nights
on the ice...

649
01:26:57,680 --> 01:26:59,560
...and not freeze.

650
01:27:00,320 --> 01:27:05,520
I can drink a river of blood
and not burst.

651
01:27:06,360 --> 01:27:10,560
Show me... your enemies!

652
01:27:11,680 --> 01:27:15,840
What you hate, so will we.

653
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:18,680
No one hates better than us.

654
01:27:22,400 --> 01:27:26,840
And you can...
guarantee Miraz's death?

655
01:27:27,880 --> 01:27:29,760
And more.

656
01:27:42,000 --> 01:27:44,480
Let the circle be drawn.

657
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,800
Wait.

658
01:29:00,520 --> 01:29:02,160
This isn't what I wanted.

659
01:29:04,800 --> 01:29:09,880
One drop of Adam's blood
and you free me.

660
01:29:09,960 --> 01:29:12,200
Then I am yours, my king.

661
01:29:13,000 --> 01:29:14,400
No!

662
01:29:36,360 --> 01:29:37,680
Stop!

663
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:21,640
Come on! Come.

664
01:30:22,680 --> 01:30:24,200
Get away from him!

665
01:30:29,640 --> 01:30:31,080
Peter, dear.

666
01:30:31,840 --> 01:30:33,440
I've missed you.

667
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,120
Come.

668
01:30:37,680 --> 01:30:39,520
Just one drop.

669
01:30:41,760 --> 01:30:44,480
You know you can't do this alone.

670
01:31:15,360 --> 01:31:18,280
I know. You had it sorted.

671
01:32:06,200 --> 01:32:09,200
Why did you never tell me
about my father?

672
01:32:11,880 --> 01:32:16,800
My mother was a Black Dwarf
from the Northern Mountains.

673
01:32:19,120 --> 01:32:21,560
I risked my life all these years

674
01:32:21,640 --> 01:32:25,280
so that one day...

675
01:32:25,360 --> 01:32:29,400
...you might be a better king
than those before you.

676
01:32:32,080 --> 01:32:34,400
Then I have failed you.

677
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:42,800
Everything I told you,
everything I didn't,

678
01:32:42,880 --> 01:32:46,800
it was only because I believe in you.

679
01:32:46,880 --> 01:32:52,840
You have a chance to become the most
noble contradiction in history.

680
01:32:56,080 --> 01:32:59,480
The Telmarine who saved Narnia.

681
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:26,120
You're lucky, you know.

682
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:29,960
What do you mean?

683
01:33:31,520 --> 01:33:33,360
To have seen him.

684
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:39,800
I wish he'd just given me
some sort of proof.

685
01:33:42,080 --> 01:33:45,840
Maybe we're the ones who need
to prove ourselves to him.

686
01:33:50,800 --> 01:33:53,720
Pete. You'd better come quickly.

687
01:34:56,720 --> 01:35:00,400
Cakes and kettledrums.
That's your next big plan?

688
01:35:01,200 --> 01:35:05,960
Sending a little girl into the darkest
parts of the forest? Alone!

689
01:35:06,080 --> 01:35:10,000
- It's our only chance.
- And she won't be alone.

690
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:15,840
Haven't enough of us died already?

691
01:35:15,920 --> 01:35:20,360
Nikabrik was my friend too.
But he lost hope.

692
01:35:21,120 --> 01:35:24,120
Queen Lucy hasn't.
And neither have I.

693
01:35:25,240 --> 01:35:26,640
For Aslan.

694
01:35:27,280 --> 01:35:28,800
For Aslan!

695
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:37,280
- Then I'm going with you.
- No. We need you here.

696
01:35:37,360 --> 01:35:40,320
We have to hold them off
until Lucy and Susan get back.

697
01:35:41,360 --> 01:35:42,920
If I may...

698
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,760
Miraz may be a tyrant
and a murderer...

699
01:35:53,560 --> 01:35:58,320
...but as king, he is
subject to the traditions...

700
01:35:58,400 --> 01:36:02,240
...and expectations of his people.

701
01:36:02,320 --> 01:36:06,080
There is one in particular
that may buy us some time.

702
01:36:14,400 --> 01:36:17,040
Perhaps they intend to surrender.

703
01:36:17,120 --> 01:36:18,640
No.

704
01:36:21,160 --> 01:36:23,600
They are much too noble for that.

705
01:36:25,920 --> 01:36:30,400
"I, Peter, by the gift of Aslan,
by election and by conquest,

706
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:35,600
High King of Narnia, Lord of Cair
Paravel and emperor of the Lone Islands,

707
01:36:35,680 --> 01:36:38,800
in order to prevent
the abominable effusion of blood,

708
01:36:38,880 --> 01:36:43,480
do hereby challenge the usurper Miraz to
single combat upon the field of battle.

709
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:48,720
The fight shall be to the death.
The reward shall be total surrender."

710
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:54,080
- Tell me, Prince Edmund...
- King.

711
01:36:55,160 --> 01:36:59,360
- Pardon me?
- It's King Edmund, actually.

712
01:36:59,440 --> 01:37:02,120
Just "King," though.
Peter's the high king.

713
01:37:03,040 --> 01:37:05,000
I know, it's confusing.

714
01:37:07,640 --> 01:37:10,480
Why would we risk such a proposal

715
01:37:10,560 --> 01:37:13,920
when our armies could
wipe you out by nightfall?

716
01:37:14,960 --> 01:37:17,920
Haven't you already
underestimated our numbers?

717
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:23,640
I mean, only a week ago
Narnians were extinct.

718
01:37:23,720 --> 01:37:25,920
And so you will be again.

719
01:37:26,000 --> 01:37:28,280
Well, then you should have
little to fear.

720
01:37:30,200 --> 01:37:32,240
This is not a question of bravery.

721
01:37:32,320 --> 01:37:36,040
So you're bravely refusing
to fight a swordsman half your age?

722
01:37:38,080 --> 01:37:41,200
I didn't say I refused.

723
01:37:41,280 --> 01:37:43,800
You shall have our support,
Your Majesty.

724
01:37:43,880 --> 01:37:45,640
Whatever your decision.

725
01:37:45,720 --> 01:37:50,720
Sire, our military advantage alone
provides the perfect excuse to avoid

726
01:37:50,800 --> 01:37:53,800
- what might otherwise be...
- I'm not avoiding anything!

727
01:37:55,480 --> 01:37:57,040
I was merely pointing out

728
01:37:57,120 --> 01:38:00,000
that my lord is well
within his rights to refuse.

729
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,560
His Majesty would never refuse.

730
01:38:03,640 --> 01:38:06,400
He relishes the chance
to show the people

731
01:38:06,480 --> 01:38:08,720
the courage of their new king.

732
01:38:13,960 --> 01:38:15,040
You.

733
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:23,520
You should hope your brother's sword
is sharper than his pen.

734
01:38:28,240 --> 01:38:32,680
Destrier has always served me well.
You are in good hands.

735
01:38:32,760 --> 01:38:34,400
Or hooves.

736
01:38:40,080 --> 01:38:43,320
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

737
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:48,960
Look.

738
01:38:51,080 --> 01:38:53,400
Maybe it is time you had this back.

739
01:38:55,960 --> 01:39:00,400
Why don't you hold on to it.
You might need to call me again.

740
01:39:07,440 --> 01:39:11,600
- You might need to call me again?
- Oh, shut up.

741
01:39:57,720 --> 01:40:00,680
If it should appear
to be going poorly...

742
01:40:05,520 --> 01:40:07,600
Understood, Your Majesty.

743
01:40:21,120 --> 01:40:25,280
I hope you won't be too disappointed
when I survive.

744
01:40:55,840 --> 01:40:58,400
There is still time to surrender.

745
01:41:00,720 --> 01:41:02,640
Well, feel free.

746
01:41:02,760 --> 01:41:05,200
How many more must die for the throne?

747
01:41:06,200 --> 01:41:07,800
Just one.

748
01:41:33,240 --> 01:41:35,920
- Ride!
- They've seen us!

749
01:41:50,840 --> 01:41:53,040
- Take the reins.
- What are you doing?

750
01:41:53,120 --> 01:41:57,840
I'm sorry, Lucy. But it looks as if
you'll be going alone after all.

751
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:17,360
Are you sure you don't need that horn?

752
01:44:33,600 --> 01:44:37,160
Does His Highness need a respite?

753
01:44:37,240 --> 01:44:38,920
Five minutes?

754
01:44:40,160 --> 01:44:41,360
Three!

755
01:45:00,880 --> 01:45:02,600
Lucy?

756
01:45:02,680 --> 01:45:06,040
She got through... with a little help.

757
01:45:06,120 --> 01:45:09,080
- Thanks.
- Well, you were busy.

758
01:45:09,160 --> 01:45:13,840
I assume you won't let things
get that close again!

759
01:45:19,040 --> 01:45:22,080
You better get up there.
Just in case.

760
01:45:22,160 --> 01:45:24,640
I don't expect the Telmarines
will keep their word.

761
01:45:29,480 --> 01:45:31,880
- Sorry.
- It's all right.

762
01:45:31,960 --> 01:45:33,560
Be careful.

763
01:45:34,920 --> 01:45:36,400
Keep smiling.

764
01:45:49,040 --> 01:45:51,080
How does he look to you?

765
01:45:51,600 --> 01:45:53,080
Young.

766
01:45:55,800 --> 01:46:00,120
But His Majesty's doing
extremely well... for his age.

767
01:46:08,520 --> 01:46:10,000
I think it's dislocated.

768
01:46:14,680 --> 01:46:18,080
What do you think happens
back home if you die here?

769
01:46:22,160 --> 01:46:25,200
You know you've always been there,
and I never really...

770
01:46:28,360 --> 01:46:29,600
Save it for later.

771
01:48:18,840 --> 01:48:20,320
Respite!

772
01:48:23,880 --> 01:48:25,320
Respite.

773
01:48:26,120 --> 01:48:28,480
Now's not the time for chivalry, Peter!

774
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,040
Show no mercy!

775
01:48:51,040 --> 01:48:53,600
Look out!

776
01:49:19,520 --> 01:49:21,960
What's the matter, boy?

777
01:49:23,080 --> 01:49:25,240
Too cowardly to take a life?

778
01:49:29,280 --> 01:49:31,360
It's not mine to take.

779
01:50:13,720 --> 01:50:16,240
Perhaps I was wrong.

780
01:50:16,320 --> 01:50:21,840
Maybe you do have the makings
of a Telmarine king after all.

781
01:50:35,400 --> 01:50:37,480
Not one like you.

782
01:50:46,760 --> 01:50:49,720
Keep your life.

783
01:50:49,800 --> 01:50:53,240
But I am giving the Narnians
back their kingdom.

784
01:51:24,360 --> 01:51:25,600
My king.

785
01:51:28,880 --> 01:51:33,160
I'll deal with you when this is over.

786
01:51:34,040 --> 01:51:37,040
It is over.

787
01:51:51,560 --> 01:51:55,800
Treachery! They shot him!

788
01:51:55,920 --> 01:51:58,320
They murdered our king!

789
01:51:59,160 --> 01:52:01,160
Be ready!

790
01:52:02,960 --> 01:52:04,120
Peter!

791
01:52:10,720 --> 01:52:12,480
Go!

792
01:52:19,680 --> 01:52:22,880
To arms, Telmar!

793
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,720
To arms!

794
01:52:28,840 --> 01:52:29,880
Loose!

795
01:52:55,440 --> 01:52:56,920
Cavalry!

796
01:52:58,840 --> 01:53:02,680
Attack!

797
01:53:19,160 --> 01:53:21,480
Archers to the ready!

798
01:53:45,200 --> 01:53:46,960
Narnians!

799
01:53:47,040 --> 01:53:50,360
Charge!

800
01:54:11,600 --> 01:54:14,800
One, two...

801
01:54:14,880 --> 01:54:17,320
Three, four...

802
01:54:17,400 --> 01:54:20,240
Five, six...

803
01:54:22,640 --> 01:54:24,040
Take your aim!

804
01:54:25,800 --> 01:54:27,200
Stay with them!

805
01:54:29,480 --> 01:54:32,640
Eight, nine...

806
01:54:32,720 --> 01:54:34,760
Get ready!

807
01:54:36,360 --> 01:54:38,000
Now!

808
01:55:00,200 --> 01:55:03,080
Stop! Back! Back!

809
01:55:04,680 --> 01:55:07,360
Hold it now! Hold it!

810
01:55:10,520 --> 01:55:11,560
Now!

811
01:55:27,280 --> 01:55:30,160
Charge!

812
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:44,120
Charge!

813
01:56:11,280 --> 01:56:12,960
You're a mouse.

814
01:56:13,040 --> 01:56:15,400
You people have no imagination.

815
01:56:44,160 --> 01:56:45,920
Move it!

816
01:56:46,000 --> 01:56:47,840
Loose! Loose!

817
01:56:55,920 --> 01:56:57,440
Lucy?

818
01:57:06,320 --> 01:57:07,920
Back to the How!

819
01:57:13,160 --> 01:57:14,680
Cut off their escape!

820
01:57:14,760 --> 01:57:16,080
Loose!

821
01:57:17,880 --> 01:57:19,840
Loose!

822
01:57:27,040 --> 01:57:30,440
Brace yourselves!

823
01:57:31,680 --> 01:57:33,280
Back to the How!

824
01:58:21,120 --> 01:58:22,720
Crush them all.

825
01:59:33,600 --> 01:59:34,680
Aslan!

826
01:59:44,200 --> 01:59:47,520
I knew it was you.
The whole time, I knew it.

827
01:59:47,600 --> 01:59:49,880
But the others didn't believe me.

828
01:59:49,960 --> 01:59:52,400
And why would that stop you
from coming to me?

829
01:59:55,240 --> 01:59:58,080
I'm sorry. I was too scared
to come alone.

830
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:02,040
Why wouldn't you show yourself?

831
02:00:02,120 --> 02:00:05,400
Why couldn't you come roaring in
and save us like last time?

832
02:00:05,480 --> 02:00:09,040
Things never happen
the same way twice, dear one.

833
02:00:14,080 --> 02:00:19,200
If I'd have come earlier, would everyone
who died... could I have stopped that?

834
02:00:21,240 --> 02:00:24,320
We can never know
what would have happened, Lucy.

835
02:00:24,400 --> 02:00:28,640
But what will happen
is another matter entirely.

836
02:00:28,720 --> 02:00:31,160
- You mean you'll help?
- Of course.

837
02:00:31,240 --> 02:00:34,920
- As will you.
- Oh, I wish I was braver.

838
02:00:35,000 --> 02:00:37,880
If you were any braver,
you'd be a lioness.

839
02:00:37,960 --> 02:00:42,960
Now, I think your friends
have slept long enough, don't you?

840
02:01:14,960 --> 02:01:17,040
Come on!

841
02:02:20,760 --> 02:02:22,160
Lucy.

842
02:02:48,480 --> 02:02:50,800
For Aslan!

843
02:02:56,240 --> 02:02:59,040
We can defeat them
if we draw them to the river.

844
02:02:59,120 --> 02:03:02,160
We must regroup. To Beruna!

845
02:03:02,240 --> 02:03:04,280
To the bridge!

846
02:04:02,200 --> 02:04:03,960
Charge!

847
02:04:32,040 --> 02:04:34,920
What is happening?

848
02:04:35,000 --> 02:04:37,960
- The river!
- Retreat!

849
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:40,040
Back! Back!

850
02:05:42,160 --> 02:05:43,760
Come on.

851
02:06:12,320 --> 02:06:14,760
Assemble on that bank!

852
02:06:14,960 --> 02:06:17,200
You will not be harmed!

853
02:06:18,880 --> 02:06:21,200
Surrender your weapons!

854
02:06:23,120 --> 02:06:25,440
Take off the armour!

855
02:06:42,400 --> 02:06:46,040
Rise, kings and queens of Narnia.

856
02:06:49,640 --> 02:06:50,960
All of you.

857
02:06:56,560 --> 02:06:58,480
I do not think I am ready.

858
02:06:58,560 --> 02:07:01,840
It's for that very reason
I know you are.

859
02:07:50,200 --> 02:07:52,880
Thank you, Your Majesty.

860
02:07:52,960 --> 02:07:55,160
Thank you.

861
02:07:57,240 --> 02:08:02,200
Hail, Aslan!
It is a great honour to be in...

862
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:08,920
I'm completely out of countenance.

863
02:08:08,960 --> 02:08:12,840
I must crave your indulgence
for appearing in this unseemly fashion.

864
02:08:14,680 --> 02:08:16,760
Perhaps a drop more?

865
02:08:16,840 --> 02:08:19,920
- I don't think it does that.
- You could have a go.

866
02:08:21,280 --> 02:08:22,960
It becomes you well, small one.

867
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,840
All the same, great king,

868
02:08:25,920 --> 02:08:31,440
I regret that I must withdraw, for a
tail is the honour and glory of a mouse.

869
02:08:31,520 --> 02:08:34,960
Perhaps you think too much
of your honour, friend.

870
02:08:35,040 --> 02:08:39,920
Well, it's not just the honour.
It's also great for balance.

871
02:08:40,040 --> 02:08:43,520
And climbing.
And grabbing things.

872
02:08:43,600 --> 02:08:47,000
May it please Your High Majesty,
we will not bear the shame

873
02:08:47,080 --> 02:08:50,080
of wearing an honour
denied to our chief.

874
02:08:50,160 --> 02:08:53,080
Not for the sake of your dignity,

875
02:08:53,680 --> 02:08:55,920
but for the love of your people.

876
02:09:01,960 --> 02:09:06,440
Look! Thank you, my liege.
I will treasure it always.

877
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:11,240
From this day forward it will serve
as a great reminder of my huge humility.

878
02:09:13,280 --> 02:09:17,360
Now, where is this dear little friend
you've told me so much about?

879
02:09:37,520 --> 02:09:39,600
Do you see him now?

880
02:10:44,520 --> 02:10:47,440
Because you have snuck in...

881
02:10:47,520 --> 02:10:50,640
I'm sorry, but their future
in that world shall be good.

882
02:10:51,600 --> 02:10:53,680
Your Majesty?

883
02:11:03,360 --> 02:11:06,840
We are ready.
Everyone has assembled.

884
02:11:16,160 --> 02:11:20,560
Narnia belongs to the Narnians,
just as it does to man.

885
02:11:20,640 --> 02:11:24,880
Any Telmarines who want to stay
and live in peace are welcome to.

886
02:11:24,960 --> 02:11:27,360
But for any of you who wish,

887
02:11:27,440 --> 02:11:31,040
Aslan will return you
to the home of our forefathers.

888
02:11:31,120 --> 02:11:34,160
It's been generations
since we left Telmar.

889
02:11:34,240 --> 02:11:36,560
We're not referring to Telmar.

890
02:11:36,640 --> 02:11:39,360
Your ancestors were seafaring brigands.

891
02:11:39,440 --> 02:11:42,160
Pirates run aground on an island.

892
02:11:42,200 --> 02:11:47,360
There they found a cave, a rare chasm
that brought them here from their world.

893
02:11:47,440 --> 02:11:50,160
The same world as our kings and queens.

894
02:11:52,760 --> 02:11:55,120
It is to that island I can return you.

895
02:11:55,200 --> 02:11:59,280
It is a good place for any
who wish to make a new start.

896
02:12:01,400 --> 02:12:02,520
I will go.

897
02:12:04,800 --> 02:12:06,440
I will accept the offer.

898
02:12:14,320 --> 02:12:15,960
So will we.

899
02:12:20,280 --> 02:12:26,120
Because you have spoken first,
your future in that world shall be good.

900
02:13:08,880 --> 02:13:10,960
- Where did they go?
- They killed them.

901
02:13:11,040 --> 02:13:14,800
How do we know he is not
leading us to our death?

902
02:13:14,880 --> 02:13:18,440
Sire. If my example
can be of any service,

903
02:13:18,520 --> 02:13:21,320
I will take 11 mice through
with no delay.

904
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:32,360
- We'll go.
- We will?

905
02:13:32,440 --> 02:13:35,600
Come on. Our time's up.

906
02:13:37,120 --> 02:13:39,040
After all...

907
02:13:40,400 --> 02:13:43,040
...we're not really
needed here anymore.

908
02:13:47,440 --> 02:13:49,920
I will look after it until you return.

909
02:13:50,000 --> 02:13:52,040
I'm afraid that's just it.

910
02:13:54,040 --> 02:13:55,800
We're not coming back.

911
02:13:58,880 --> 02:13:59,920
We're not?

912
02:14:00,840 --> 02:14:02,160
You two are.

913
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:07,040
At least, I think he means you two.

914
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,920
But why?

915
02:14:10,000 --> 02:14:13,280
- Did they do something wrong?
- Quite the opposite, dear one.

916
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,320
But all things have their time.

917
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:18,800
Your brother and sister have learned
what they can from this world.

918
02:14:18,920 --> 02:14:21,520
Now it's time for them
to live in their own.

919
02:14:23,600 --> 02:14:25,600
It's all right, Lu.

920
02:14:27,120 --> 02:14:29,960
It's not how I thought it would be...

921
02:14:30,040 --> 02:14:32,400
...but it's all right.

922
02:14:32,480 --> 02:14:36,160
One day you'll see, too.
Come on.

923
02:15:10,480 --> 02:15:12,480
I'm glad I came back.

924
02:15:13,920 --> 02:15:16,000
I wish we had more time together.

925
02:15:18,440 --> 02:15:20,800
It would never have worked, anyway.

926
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,560
Why not?

927
02:15:22,640 --> 02:15:25,280
I am 1,300 years older than you.

928
02:15:45,840 --> 02:15:49,000
I'm sure when I'm older I'll understand.

929
02:15:50,040 --> 02:15:53,000
I'm older and don't think
I want to understand.

930
02:17:10,560 --> 02:17:13,080
Aren't you coming, Phyllis?

931
02:17:23,360 --> 02:17:26,120
You don't think there's
any way we can get back?

932
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:29,680
I've left my new torch in Narnia.
